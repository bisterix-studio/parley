---

A Dialogue Node defines a passage of dialogue for a character within the
Dialogue Sequence. It is associated with a character which can be used to
enhance the displayed dialogue. You can find all sorts of Dialogue Sequence
examples in the Parley `examples` folder.

## Pre-requisites

- Familiarise yourself with the [Dialogue Node](../concepts/dialogue-node.md)
  docs.
- Parley is installed and running in your Godot Editor.
- You have created a basic Dialogue Sequence before. Consult the
  [getting started guide](./create-dialogue-sequence.md) for more info.

   Node Editor.
3. Click the `Save` button in the Parley editor and there we have it! Our first
   dialogue sequence with dialogue.
4. Now connect this Node up with other Nodes to continue the Dialogue Sequence
