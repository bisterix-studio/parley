In this chapter of the Parley documentation, you'll be introduced to the plugin.
Create a new Dialogue Sequence, add Nodes, connect them up, test it all out, and
deploy to your game.

The documentation assumes you have the latest version of
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) installed on your system and have also
[installed the Parley plugin](../getting-started/installation.md).

## Quick start

To go from zero to an integrated Parley Dialogue Sequence running within your
game, follow these guides in order:

1. [Installation](./installation.md)
2. [Create a Dialogue Sequence](./create-dialogue-sequenceallation.md)
3. [Run a Dialogue Sequence](./run-dialogue-sequence.md)
