In this chapter of the Parley documentation, you'll be introduced to the plugin.
Create a new Dialogue Sequence, add nodes, connect them up, test it all out, and
deploy to your game.

The documentation assumes you have the latest version of
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) installed on your system and have also
[installed the Parley plugin](./installation.md).
