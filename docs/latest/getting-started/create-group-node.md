  Create a Group Node
---

As its name suggests, a Group Node gives the ability to group Nodes that fall
within its boundary in the Parley Dialogue Sequence graph view. You can find all
sorts of Dialogue Sequence examples in the Parley
[`examples`](https://github.com/bisterix-studio/parley/tree/main/examples)
folder.

## Pre-requisites

- Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the
  [Group Node](../nodes/group-node.md) docs.
- Parley is [installed](./installation.md) and running in your Godot Editor.
- You have created a basic Dialogue Sequence before. Consult the
  [getting started guide](./create-dialogue-sequence.md) for more info.

## Instructions

![Create a Group Node](../../../www/static/docs/create-group-node/create-group-node.gif)

1. Create a Group Node using the `Insert` dropdown and resize the created node
   accordingly using the resize button in the bottom right of the node.
2. Click on the created Group Node in the graph view to open up the Group Node
   Editor.
3. Enter a name for what the Group Node represents. Try and keep it as
   descriptive as possible! In this example, we write: `My lovely group`
4. Choose the colour you want for the Group Node using the colour picker until
   you get the colour that works for you.

> [tip]: Any node that overlaps with the Group Node will be considered part of
> the Group Node group.

5. Move the Group Node around and note the nodes inside group boundaries moving
   with the Group Node.
6. Have a play around by adjusting the size of the Group Node or moving nodes in
   and out of the Group Node boundaries to group and ungroup as you see fit!
